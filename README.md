The PHP based LMS project is a comprehensive Learning Management System that aims to provide an efficient and effective way of managing online learning activities. The system has a range of features that include a login system for both students and teachers, course selling, batch management, payment gateway integration, and user profile management.

The student and teacher registration process involves filling out a registration form with personal and contact details. Once registered, students and teachers can log in to their accounts with their unique credentials. The login system is secure and designed to protect user data.

The student profile and teacher profile sections allow users to manage their personal information, view their course details, and track their progress. This information is stored in a secure database, and users can access it at any time.

Teachers can set their own prices and course details, and students can browse through available courses and make purchases. The system has a payment gateway integration with the Razorpay API, enabling secure online transactions.

The batch management feature enables teachers to create batches and assign students to specific batches. Teachers can also view batch progress reports and student performance reports.

In conclusion, the PHP based LMS project is an efficient and comprehensive system that allows teachers and students to manage their learning activities with ease. The system includes a secure login system, user profile management, course selling, batch management, payment gateway integration, and other features essential to a modern-day Learning Management System.
